¸?*+{#} 	-> quantifiers
[...] 	-> charachter ranges
\s		-> shorthand character codes
(..|..)	-> grouping and alternation
^...$		-> anchors
i		-> modifiers


pitfalls:
	-backspace, literally backspace
	-[A-z] it will also catch parentheses because it follows the "unicode" table A,B,C...Z,[,],{...a,b...z
	->the parentheses are in between, so they will also be taken
	-[0-9] != [9-0]

repetation quantifiers
	- ? -> zero or one times
	- * -> zero or more times(unlimited)
	- + -> one or more times(unlimited)

oredr of alternations:
PCRE
	->left-most (first) match
POSIX
	->left-most longest match
	
	->with multiple choices left one is that we most desire but it shouldn't block others
