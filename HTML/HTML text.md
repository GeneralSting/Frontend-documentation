# HTML text

## structural hierarchy

- use single &lt;`h1`&gt; element per page
- headings should always be in the correct order in the hierarchy
- documents with many levels (h1, h2..., many headings) becomes unwieldy and difficult to navigate

<hr>

- users scans quickly to find relevant content, often just reading the headings, to begin with.
- search engines indexing page consider the contents of headings as important keywords for influencing the page's search rankings
- easier for visually impaired people
