Promise
	-Object that represents the eventual completion
	 or failure of an asynchronous operation,
	 and its resulting value.
Promise States
	-Pending	-> waiting for API to give data
	-Fulfileld	-> returns data
	-Rejected	-> Async call is failed
	
	-Settled/Resolved	-> Promise is in fulfilled or rejected
				   state.

Promises are not lazy
	-Promises don't wait for us to request value before 
	 they execute

AXIOS

return axios

onerror function is only called when there is an error with
server, if error for example is 404 then it is gonna be
onload function called.

Promise.all -> when you have more then one promeise so you
can do sth when ALL promises are resolved, it wait for all
promises to be resolved->either all fulfill or one rejects
	Promise.all([promises array])

allSettled -> function used for multiple promises so you
can show which promise is fulfilled and which is rejected

async/await != Promsies
	->they all try to make a same goal, same thing

await -> must be used inside of async function
	-> only blocks the current function
	-> can be used on funcitons that returns promises

async/await -> for catching errors you need to use try catch
